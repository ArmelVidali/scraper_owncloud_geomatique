# Web scraper & email sender to get schedule updates

Web scraper to get updates of my master degrees schedule and send an email to my classmates when a change occurs.
Users send an email stating their class (1rst or 2nd year) to the adress to get updates.

Sends an email with an attached image coming from a dataframe extraction for next week classes every sunday (or each time the schedule changes), with a hint in the message object stating if there are classes on wensday.

Runs everyday at 11h30
